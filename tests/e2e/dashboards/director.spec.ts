/**
 * Director dashboard (layout platform/identity/config/dashboards/director.yaml, which extends the Faculty layout; the role exists in the
 * theatre-academy profile). Issue #319.
 *
 * What runs depends on what has shipped; each skip says what it waits for:
 * - always: a director signs in and lands on their dashboard;
 * - for every widget of the layout whose module is in apps/frontend/config/modules.enabled.yaml and exports it: the
 *   panel renders by its registered title and shows its empty state, or says its data is not available while the
 *   backend is missing;
 * - widgets of modules not enabled yet, or not exported yet, are skipped, naming the module and the sprint batch that
 *   builds it: productions (#318, PR #454), projects (#339), timetable-attendance and examinations (#325) and lms (#326);
 * - data journey: a booking later today on a rehearsal room the director approves shows in
 *   facility-booking.bookings-today. Facility staff set up the room and make the booking (the director holds
 *   facility-booking-approver's grants, which do not include managing resources).
 *
 * facilities is not in the Trial plan (platform/billing/config/plans.yaml), so the super admin moves the organisation
 * to Standard first. The empty-state tests run before any data is created (serial mode). Loading states are covered
 * by the modules' unit tests, not here.
